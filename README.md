# Linkedin Webscraper
 Created a webscraper that takes in Linkedin URLs scraped from Google Chrome Search and then scrapes every Linkedin profile information.

# Note
 The webscrapers that are readily available on other repositories do not seem to work on my work station for some reason. Thus, my personal webscraper may also not work for you but do feel free to try it out!

# Discretion
 Although the legal terms of webscraping on Linkedin public data is rather blurry, scraping data from Linkedin is nonethless still a difficult task due to its security features. I recommend creating multiple dummy accounts for this task to avoid your personal account from being suspended!
