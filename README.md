# Linkedin Webscraper
 Created a webscraper that takes in Linkedin URLs scraped from Google Chrome Search and then scrapes every Linkedin profile information.

# Note
 The webscrapers that are readily available on other repositories do not seem to work for some reason. Thus, my personal webscraper may    also not work for others but do feel free to try it out!


# Dependencies
1. Selenium
2. BeautifulSoup
